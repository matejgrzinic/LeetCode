Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

**Note:**

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
